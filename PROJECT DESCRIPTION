# CLIMATE-SCREENING-PROJECT
I Built an awesome simple application that helps you generate real-time weather of your city using python. 
Here I request the data from a third-party API. 
The code reads and converts the data received(JSON format) from the server to a user-friendly, well-organised, readable format displayed as the output.
